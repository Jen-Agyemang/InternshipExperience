# InternshipExperience
I had the opportunity to work with "Prosper IT Consulting" as an internship student for two weeks. I joined couple of team of developers in an already build application. I had the opportunity working on tickets to solve some of the issues users were facing using the application. The entire project was about a clockin/clockout login/logout application for users and administrators to use on a daily basis to access work data and to have a great experience with the application. 
Some of the languages I used to complete the project were c#, html, css. The framework for the entire project was Microsoft MVC. 
I also did testing and debugging the code.
