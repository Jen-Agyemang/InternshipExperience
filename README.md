# InternshipExperience
I had the opportunity to work with "Prosper IT Consulting" as an intern. I joined couple of team of developers in an already build application. I had the opportunity working on tickets to solve some of the issues users were facing using the application. The entire project was about user management system, time of request and message survey. 
My role was a full stack developer.
I had the opportunity making changes to the data models - the data model had a lot of complications which resulted in users having a lot of confusion. To make the application a comfortable one to use, I fixed the methods that were being used in the first place to make it work without people/users using it wrong.
I also had the opportunity to work on calender API to stop draggable calenders.
I did use Ajax methods to make adjustment to the styling - so that the styling stays consistent based on data.
The team management that was used were - version control / azure devOps, scrum agile methodology, daily standups and planning.
Some of the languages I used to complete the project were ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS. 
I also had the opportunity to perform quality control - testing and debugging of code.
